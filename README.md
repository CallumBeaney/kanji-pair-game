Each grid of 16 kanji is built from 8 random seed words. Tap 2 kanji and, if they turn green, you've found one - find them all to get a new grid.
These 16 kanji might contain more than just those 8 combinations... when you find such a word, the tiles will briefly turn gold, and the word added to your list.
