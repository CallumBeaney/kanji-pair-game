Each grid of 16 kanji is built from 8 random seed words.  
Tap 2 kanji and if they turn green, you've found one.  
But, language is tricky - the 16 kanji might have more than 8 combinations...  
sometimes a kanji you've already used might turn gold.   
Try pairing it with another grey kanji if you get stuck.  
This game is intended for intermediate-advanced learners of Japanese.  

i made this over a couple of days when i had the flu and couldn't sleep in the evenings  
making it was  
emotionally turbulent
