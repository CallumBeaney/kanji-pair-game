Each grid of 16 kanji is built from 8 random seed words. Tap 2 kanji and, if they turn green, you've found one - find them all to get a new grid.
These 16 kanji might contain more than just those 8 combinations... when you find such a word, the tiles will briefly turn gold, and the word added to your list.  
  
This was made after finding "Japanese Wordle" and similar games not really made on the language's own terms, and finding Anki study a bit repetitive.
